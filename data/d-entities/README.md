Entity Annotations
==================

This specific dataset contains entity annotations as generated by
Yao et al. for the Jacana QA system.  ClearNLP NER (2013 model?) has
been run on the question texts, and in addition all NPs as produced
by StanfordParser have been used as potential entities.  See
freebase-data/webquestions/ in Jacana's source code.
